      <title>Prototyping, reflection, and identity: Unusual applications of the WordPress REST API</title>

      <description>Speaking at LoopConf was an incredible (and terrifying) opportunity. Going up to that podium as someone who knows just enough PHP to get by - and speaking about my experiences to a room full of the smartest WordPress developers out there - is something I&amp;rsquo;ll always be grateful for. But I&amp;rsquo;ll never forget the feeling of having K. Adam White introduce himself to me and say how much my talk meant to him.</description>

      <description>From the teaser:
Have you been faking it this whole time? Yeah, me too. In this session we’re going to have a heart to heart about what it’s like to experience imposter syndrome and what leads us to put unending pressure on ourselves to achieve. We’ll talk about growing up, entering the workforce and the challenges imposters face in their careers.
And if you’re not an imposter, that’s okay too, because we’ll also talk about ways to create environments that encourage everyone to contribute and take risks.</description>

      <description>From the teaser:
The inside look at how the four most terrifying words ever uttered in development history have worked out for Boston University. We’ll cover seven years of successes and lessons learned in framework development, including enforcing brand guidelines in the site, when to allow customization and when to say no, and how on earth to make one codebase flexible enough to accommodate the requests we foresee – and the ones we don’t.</description>

      <description>From the teaser:
You don’t know it yet, but documentation is actually AMAZING. Channel your inner educator and get inspired! We’ll talk about the different ways developers and end users try to solve problems, where they look to find information, and how you can get ahead of those needs by putting your recommendations in those places. Documentation is an amazing and complex problem that doesn’t end at a wiki full of pages—so let’s talk about how we can use our UI, different ways of phrasing and explaining, and the features we have available in WordPress to be the best teachers we can be.</description>

      <title>The Good Life of Marcia Deihl</title>

      <description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since something I&amp;rsquo;ve done has gotten personal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know the feeling - when something is important, and it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; important, but it&amp;rsquo;s not even just important to you. It&amp;rsquo;s important to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>First Impressions: Hugo</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing in Markdown for a few months now, and it&amp;rsquo;s been amazing. I mean, anything that enables my Sublime Text habit is going to make me pretty happy, but I know me, and at heart I&amp;rsquo;m a designer. If you give me the ability to design, I will design. Markdown prevents me from doing that so I actually write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I finally decided to tackle the long overdue task of redoing my portfolio, a static site generator seemed like the natural choice. Because let&amp;rsquo;s be honest - I haven&amp;rsquo;t logged into my Wordpress backend in months.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Faking Watercolor Bleed Using a Simple PNG</title>

      <description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a confession to make. That watercolor bleed effect on Marcia Deihl? Nothing more than a simple PNG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just didn&amp;rsquo;t have the time to learn &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;canvas&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; this time around.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Realistic SVG Handwriting</title>
      <link>http://www.lastletterdesign.com/realistic-svg-handwriting/</link>

      <guid>http://www.lastletterdesign.com/realistic-svg-handwriting/</guid>
      <description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fact: SVG letters will never look like real handwriting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew I wanted a handwriting effect, and I knew you could animate SVGs. Some quick Googling led me to the most common technique - animate the stroke dash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the idea: if you can find the length of a line, and make a dash so large it takes up the entire length of the line, you can animate the length of that dash so it looks like it&amp;rsquo;s being drawn in. Neat!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I was lucky enough to be able to work with the amazing Joe Chan on this one. After I read this article, one thing stuck out at me, and it stuck out hard: how much dedication do you have to have to look at cells dividing for days on end? I really wanted to capture that and make it the centerpiece of the article.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever sat down, and done something, and then looked up and it&amp;rsquo;s suddenly hours later, you know what I mean when I say you do something like this, and time is different for you.</description>

      <guid>http://www.lastletterdesign.com/africa-research-series/</guid>
      <description>This three-part series gives an in-depth look at three Boston University researchers studying African culture. I used hand-drawn traditional patterns and colors to help capture the unique feel of each area while maintaining a unifying element across the series.
After the writer, Susan Seligson, described the stories to me and her own personal experiences while visiting Africa, the first thing I wanted to know was what the language sounded like. Lesotho: Life on the Edge offered a perfect opportunity to bring that into the design.</description>

      <description>The College of Communication (COM) told us two things: that they tell stories, and that they wanted a pathfinder tool to help incoming freshmen explore various programs.
Communication is a major that&amp;rsquo;s close to home for me—not because it&amp;rsquo;s my major, but because I worked at a newspaper in college, and I knew so many people in journalism. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of stigma these days around both communications and art majors.</description>

      <guid>http://www.lastletterdesign.com/dubious-dna/</guid>
      <description>The heart of this piece focuses on a researcher who is working to improve the reliability of DNA profiling for crime scenes, and throughout the article, she calls into question the many factors that may cause incorrect profiling - leading to the grim possibility an innocent person could be convicted. In my design, I let these questions hang in the air uncomfortably around the crime scenes they inhabit, like the dust, skin cells, and flecks they raise concerns about.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve never actually been to this place, or to Colorado in general. But when these guys described the area to me and showed me pictures of some of the buildings, it reminded me of home.
I grew up in Northern Michigan, which is where most people go to vacation and is widely regarded as one of the nicest places you can go in Michigan. We&amp;rsquo;ve got the nation&amp;rsquo;s most picturesque lakeshore and that small-town feel.</description>

      <description>Who&amp;rsquo;s the main audience for Boston University&amp;rsquo;s Fitness &amp;amp; Recreation Center?
Well, yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s sort of the students. But really, it&amp;rsquo;s faculty and staff, because we pay for memberships and students don&amp;rsquo;t.
Thus began the long and exhausting process of selling myself on excercising regularly.
This hadn&amp;rsquo;t gone well in the past for me. I have a famous time, The Time I Exercised. Similar to The Time I Got Drunk and The Time I Tried To Clean the Coffeepot Before Drinking the Coffee In It, it only happened once and it ended disastrously.</description>

      <description>Addison Reserve is a country club in Delray Beach, Florida, that wanted to show off major renovations and tell a new chapter in the club’s story. To do this, my teammates and I came up with the concept of taking visitors to the site on a club tour through the homepage. I was tasked with creating wireframes, final mockups, copywriting, and coding of the final site.
The homepage opens with a rotating slideshow, giving a quick visual overview of the club’s offerings.</description>

      <description>The Club at Neptune Cove is a sales tool and demo site for MembersFirst. I was responsible for the design of this fictional club’s site, the selection and editing of photography, and for writing taglines to help create the site’s tone and concept.
Many clubs are looking to attract families without alienating older members. When choosing the direction of the site, I thought long and hard about how to do this and why someone joins a country club.</description>

      <description>Fireside Follies is a monthly reading series based out of Bushwick, New York, featuring the best up and coming literature to be found anywhere.
I illustrated and designed the posters for this project in its beginning stages, incorporating new elements into the illustrations, such as music, as the event grew. It’s a beautiful thing.
For more information on Fireside Follies, take a look at the official website.</description>

      <description>Participants in the Condé Nast Summer Internship Program have the opportunity of taking part in an intern-produced, created, and published magazine which is distributed internally at the end of the summer. Put together entirely outside of our internships, this magazine required a great deal of teamwork and coordination to pull together in the short ten weeks we had, several of which were dedicated to planning.
As Art Director, I worked with the Creative Director in implementing a consistent visual theme throughout the magazine, designing several spreads and tweaking others to give the magazine a cohesive look and feel.</description>

      <description>For this assignment, we were given only the guidelines to make an infographic about something we were passionate about, for a community we were part of. For mine, I chose the MSU student community as the audience, and depression as the subject (fun fact: there was a point in time where I really wanted to be a counselor, not only because I love working with people but also because I think the act of listening to people is very important).</description>
