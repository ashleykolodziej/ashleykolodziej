This three-part series gives an in-depth look at three Boston University researchers studying African culture. I used hand-drawn traditional patterns and colors to help capture the unique feel of each area while maintaining a unifying element across the series.

After the writer, Susan Seligson,  described the stories to me and her own personal experiences while visiting Africa, the first thing I wanted to know was what the language sounded like. [Lesotho: Life on the Edge](http://www.bu.edu/research/articles/lesotho/) offered a perfect opportunity to bring that into the design. Suzie had the idea of incorporating traditional Basotho proverbs throughout the story, and I asked if they could be recorded. I took those recordings and designed and developed a minimal audio player for an experience that focuses on the language itself.
