Participants in the Condé Nast Summer Internship Program have the opportunity of taking part in an intern-produced, created, and published magazine which is distributed internally at the end of the summer. Put together entirely outside of our internships, this magazine required a great deal of teamwork and coordination to pull together in the short ten weeks we had, several of which were dedicated to planning.

As Art Director, I worked with the Creative Director in implementing a consistent visual theme throughout the magazine, designing several spreads and tweaking others to give the magazine a cohesive look and feel. In order to work around our different schedules and to provide feedback to designers, I created a blog where designers were encouraged to give criticism on each other’s work so as to get a wide variety of opinions and ideas in a timely way.
