From the teaser:

The inside look at how the four most terrifying words ever uttered in development history have worked out for Boston University. We’ll cover seven years of successes and lessons learned in framework development, including enforcing brand guidelines in the site, when to allow customization and when to say no, and how on earth to make one codebase flexible enough to accommodate the requests we foresee – and the ones we don’t. If you’ve ever considered using a theme framework to power your WordPress sites, this is the case study for you.

Presented with Steve Rudolfi at [WPCampus Online 2017](https://online.wpcampus.org/schedule/seven-years-of-framework-development-at-boston-university/).
