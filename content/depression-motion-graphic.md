For this assignment, we were given only the guidelines to make an infographic about something we were passionate about, for a community we were part of. For mine, I chose the MSU student community as the audience, and depression as the subject (fun fact: there was a point in time where I really wanted to be a counselor, not only because I love working with people but also because I think the act of listening to people is very important).

Completed in Adobe Flash, Illustrator, and some Photoshop.
