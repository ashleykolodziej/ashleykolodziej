The heart of this piece focuses on a researcher who is working to improve the reliability of DNA profiling for crime scenes, and throughout the article, she calls into question the many factors that may cause incorrect profiling - leading to the grim possibility an innocent person could be convicted. In my design, I let these questions hang in the air uncomfortably around the crime scenes they inhabit, like the dust, skin cells, and flecks they raise concerns about. Even minor movements by the user (either phone tilts or mouse movements) disturb the scene; it is deliberately delicate.
