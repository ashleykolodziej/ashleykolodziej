Fireside Follies is a monthly reading series based out of Bushwick, New York, featuring the best up and coming literature to be found anywhere.

I illustrated and designed the posters for this project in its beginning stages, incorporating new elements into the illustrations, such as music, as the event grew. Itâ€™s a beautiful thing.
