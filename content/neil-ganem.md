I was lucky enough to be able to work with the amazing Joe Chan on this one. After I read this article, one thing stuck out at me, and it stuck out hard: how much dedication do you have to have to look at cells dividing for days on end? I really wanted to capture that and make it the centerpiece of the article.

If you've ever sat down, and done something, and then looked up and it's suddenly hours later, you know what I mean when I say you do something like this, and time is different for you. That's what the design for this article is all about. I wanted everything to feel endless and repetitive, but captivating.
