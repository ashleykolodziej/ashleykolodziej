I've never actually been to this place, or to Colorado in general. But when these guys described the area to me and showed me pictures of some of the buildings, it reminded me of home.

I grew up in Northern Michigan, which is where most people go to vacation and is widely regarded as one of the nicest places you can go in Michigan. We've got the nation's most picturesque lakeshore and that small-town feel. And more than anything, we have natural wood and mounted antlers and log cabins.

So. Many. Log cabins.

So the look and feel on this wasn't a stretch for me. It was everything I was raised in.

A side note: that mountain texture in the background? Ripped paper. If I remember correctly, I sat at my desk ripping paper like a crazy lady and snapped a photo with my phone. Gotta do what you gotta do though, right?
